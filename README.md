# Beauty or Utility? A Study of Influence of Mating Motive on Consumer Product Appearance and Functionality Preference

## Abstract

This study explores how mating motives influence the preference differences between male and female consumers in terms of product appearance and functionality. Within the framework of evolutionary psychology theory, the research proposes that the activation of mating motives leads males to mimic the behavior of potential opposite-sex partners, favoring products with superior appearance to boost their competitiveness in the mating market. Utilizing two experiments, the study investigates the impact of mating motives on consumer product preferences in both public and private consumption contexts. The results indicate that the activation of mating motives significantly enhances male preference for products with superior appearance, whereas female product preferences are not significantly affected by the activation of mating motives. Furthermore, by eliminating the influences of signaling motives (through experimental research) and mindset (through theoretical deduction), the research reveals mimicry as a potential psychological mechanism through which mating motives affect male product preferences. This study not only enriches the literature on the effects of mating motives on consumer behavior but also provides new insights for product design and marketing strategies.
